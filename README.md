# habitat-plans

This repository contains habitat packages that are used as dependencies to the habitat packaged services under github.com/misthosio/tezos-habitat. Since they are mostly supporting libraries they should probably be in habitat/core-plans and we will try to get them accepted there.

All the packages have been uploaded to the habitat public depot and can be downloaded via: `hab pkg install misthosio/opam`
